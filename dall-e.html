<h2>AI Image Generator Google Editor Add-on (Dall-E)</h2>

<h4>About the Add-On</h4>

The AI Image Generator allows for easy access to the Dall-E Deep Learning model API for generating images. This is a very cool AI tool that generates semi-surreal images by mixing what it has previously learned and keywords in your query. It allows you to quickly and easily search for, and pick some of these images while you edit your document. This eases multitasking as the Dall-E model takes 1-2 minutes to run each query.


<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>I am maintaining this project with the few hours of my free time as a PhD student. If you have a problem,
    please email me at <a href="mailto:lubonjaariel@gmail.com">this address</a>. For questions about the Dall-E model,
    query tips, community support, or

<h3><a href="../terms.html">Terms of Service</a> </h3>

<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>
    The AI Images add-on does not collect or distribute any information about you or about the documents you are using it with.
</p>

<h5>Required Permissions & Your Data</h5>

<p>
    The Add-On will ask for permission to connect to an External Service. This is used to call the Dall-E model API and retrieve the images. No information except for the text you enter in the Search textbox is sent.
</p>

<p>
    The Add-On will also ask for permission to display a sidebar. It uses the sidebar to allow you to enter terms to
    search for images and display the images returned.
</p>
<p>
    It requires no other permissions.
</p>

No data is gathered about your or your Google Editor documents. All the app knows is the query you type in the search box.
